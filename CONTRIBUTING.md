# Contributing to Fluid STRATOS

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Fluid STRATOS! This project was born from curiosity and self-teaching, and we welcome contributions from everyone, regardless of formal education or background.

## About the Creator

Fluid STRATOS was created by **Máté Róbert**, a self-taught developer who never attended formal school or university. This project is proof that deep understanding and innovation come from passion, curiosity, and dedication—not from degrees or credentials.

**We especially encourage contributions from:**
- Self-taught developers and researchers
- People without formal education in CS/Physics/Math
- Anyone passionate about consciousness, AI, and fluid dynamics
- Beginners who want to learn by doing

## Ways to Contribute

### 🐛 Bug Reports

If you find a bug:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Create a new issue** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Python version, JAX version)
   - Code snippet if applicable

### 💡 Feature Suggestions

Have an idea? Great!

1. **Open an issue** with the `enhancement` label
2. Describe:
   - What problem does it solve?
   - How would it work?
   - Why is it important?
3. Be open to discussion and iteration

### 🔬 Research Contributions

This is a research project! We'd love:

- **Theoretical insights** about fluid cognition
- **Mathematical proofs** or derivations
- **Biological validation** against neuroscience data
- **Philosophical perspectives** on consciousness

### 💻 Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fluid-stratos.git
cd fluid-stratos

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Code Style

- Use **clear, descriptive names** over cryptic abbreviations
- Add **comments** explaining the "why", not the "what"
- Write **docstrings** for functions and classes
- Keep functions **focused and small** (Wu Wei principle applies to code too!)

We don't enforce strict style guidelines—readability matters more than rules.

#### Testing

While we don't have full test coverage yet, please:

1. Test your changes manually
2. Ensure existing examples still work
3. Add a new example if introducing a major feature

#### Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages:

```
Add viscosity gradient feature to FluidSTRATOS

- Implemented spatial viscosity variation
- Added get_viscosity_field() method
- Updated visualization to show viscosity map
```

### 📚 Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples and tutorials
- Translate documentation (especially to Hungarian!)
- Create video tutorials or blog posts

### 🎨 Visualizations

Love making things beautiful? We need:

- Better matplotlib visualizations
- Interactive web demos
- Animations explaining concepts
- Diagrams and illustrations

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you changed functionality
2. **Add yourself to contributors** in README.md
3. **Describe your changes** clearly in the PR description
4. **Link related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"
5. Be patient and open to feedback

### PR Review Process

We aim to review PRs within 1 week. If you don't hear back:
- Politely ping the maintainer
- Join discussions on other PRs
- Keep contributing!

## Areas We Need Help With

### High Priority
- [ ] GPU optimization for JAX (making it run faster on large grids)
- [ ] 3D extension of the cognitive field
- [ ] More sophisticated RL gardeners (PPO, A3C)
- [ ] Web-based interactive demo

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Biological neuroscience validation
- [ ] Memory consolidation mechanisms
- [ ] Multi-agent fluid systems (swarm cognition)
- [ ] Better error handling and logging

### Low Priority (but still valuable!)
- [ ] Unit tests and CI/CD
- [ ] Code optimization and refactoring
- [ ] Translation to other languages
- [ ] Docker containerization

## Community Guidelines

### Be Kind and Respectful

- This is a **judgment-free zone**
- Ask questions—there are no "stupid questions"
- Help others when you can
- Assume good intentions

### Embrace Beginner's Mind

- **"I don't know"** is a valid and valuable answer
- Share your learning process, not just results
- Mistakes are opportunities for growth
- Expertise comes in many forms

### Wu Wei Collaboration

Like the Cognitive Gardener, we practice **minimal intervention, maximum effectiveness**:

- Don't over-engineer
- Don't bikeshed (argue about trivial details)
- Trust the process
- Let ideas flow naturally

## Recognition

All contributors will be:

- Listed in README.md
- Mentioned in release notes
- Invited to co-author papers if applicable
- Given credit in any presentations or talks

## Questions?

- Open an issue with the `question` label
- Email the maintainer (if provided)
- Start a discussion in GitHub Discussions (if enabled)

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same MIT License that covers this project.
